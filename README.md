# Measuring plant health

###### Computer Science Impulse

In this project, we are using a [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) and a [Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2 NoIR](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/pi-noir-camera-v2/) to semi-accurately measure plant health. An [official project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/astropi-ndvi/) was used as a guideline.

The project consists of the following steps:
1. Capturing an image
2. Increasing contrast
3. Calculating NDVI
4. Colour mapping

Although the project is in a usable state, there are still a few quality-of-life improvements which can be made, tracked here:
- [x] Capture image
- [x] Increase contrast
- [x] Calculate NDVI
- [x] Colour map
- [x] Save processed images
- [ ] Save images based on input name
- [ ] Overlay colour guide on images (manually?)

It is recommended that the following pages are read:
- [Capture plant health with NDVI and Raspberry Pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/astropi-ndvi/)
- [Whatâ€™s that blue thing doing here?](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/whats-that-blue-thing-doing-here/)

The above pages should ideally inform the reader about how the project works. A few small changes have been made to the given project which are documented below:

### Previewing the image

In the original project, the camera was found to not have enough time to adjust to the light level. As such, a preview is launched for an arbitrary amount of time (the documentation recommends at least 2 seconds, the project uses 5). In addition, this helps take the image since the original project provides no guidance using a preview. The changed code is below.

```python
from picamera import PiCamera
import picamera.array
from time import sleep                         # changed line

cam = PiCamera()
cam.rotation = 270
cam.resolution = (1920, 1080)

stream = picamera.array.PiRGBArray(cam)
cam.start_preview()                            # changed line
sleep(5)                                       # changed line
cam.capture(stream, format='bgr', use_video_port=True)
cam.stop_preview()                             # changed line
original = stream.array
```

### Adjusting for the Pi NoIR Camera

The original project uses a [Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/), which is not an infrared camera, and hence the guide removes the infrared filter on it and installs a red filter. But since we are using Pi NoIR Camera, a blue light filter has been put onto the camera and the code edited to match.

```python
def calc_ndvi(image):
    b, g, r = cv2.split(image)
    bottom = (r.astype(float) + b.astype(float))
    bottom[bottom==0] = 0.01
    ndvi = (r.astype(float) - b) / bottom      # changed line
    return ndvi
```
